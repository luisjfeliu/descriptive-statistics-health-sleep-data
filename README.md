# Descriptive Statistics: Health and Sleep Data

This project analyzes a health and sleep quality dataset to perform descriptive statistics and visualize key health metrics. The analysis focuses on understanding distributions, identifying variable types, and calculating measures of center and spread.

## Project Structure

- **`health-data-description.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data loading, analysis, and visualization.
- **`data/`**: Directory containing the dataset (`sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset.csv`).
- **`images/`** (or root): Generated plots from the analysis, including:
  - `physical_activity_distribution.png`
  - `daily_steps_distribution.png`
  - `heart_rate_distribution.png`

## Key Analyses

The project covers the following areas based on the dataset:

1.  **Data Description**:
    -   Identification of different variable types: Continuous, Integer, Ordinal Categorical, and Nominal Categorical.

2.  **Physical Activity Analysis**:
    -   Calculation of Mean, Median, and Mode for physical activity statistics.
    -   Investigation of distribution skewness.

3.  **Daily Steps Analysis**:
    -   Computation of Standard Deviation, Maximum, Minimum, and Range.
    -   Evaluation of the spread of daily steps data.

4.  **Heart Rate Distribution**:
    -   Visualization of heart rate distribution.
    -   Identification of the distribution shape and potential outliers.

## Libraries Used

-   **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
-   **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

## Getting Started

1.  Ensure you have the required libraries installed (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
2.  Open `health-data-description.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3.  Run the cells to reproduce the analysis and generate the plots.
